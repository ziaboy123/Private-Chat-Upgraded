                <p>
                    This is a private, real-time chat application. It allows you to create temporary, anonymous chat rooms to talk with others.
                </p>
                <h2>How it works:</h2>
                <ul>
                    <li><strong>Create a Room:</strong> Click "Create a Room" on the home page. You will be given a unique 4-letter code and taken directly to your new chat room.</li>
                    <li><strong>Share the Code:</strong> Share this code with anyone you want to chat with.</li>
                    <li><strong>Join a Room:</strong> Others can enter the 4-letter code on the home page and click "Join a Room" to enter your chat.</li>
                    <li><strong>Anonymous & Private:</strong> You only need to pick a name. No other data is stored.</li>
                    <li><strong>Temporary:</strong> Chat rooms and all their messages are deleted from memory as soon as the last person leaves the room. Nothing is saved permanently.</li>
                </ul>
